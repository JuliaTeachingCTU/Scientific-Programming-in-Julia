maximal throughput of a single threaded program. Therefore modern CPUs devote much of it&#39;s real estate towards maximizing utilization of a computing resource (arithmetic logic unit - ALU), which now occupies relatively small part of the die. Below is the picture of a processor of Intel&#39;s Core architecture (one of the earliest in the series). <img src="../Intel_Core2.png" alt="cpu"/> <img src="../skylake_core_die.png" alt="cpu die"/></p><p>It contains blocks allowing to execute instructions in parallel, out of order, speculatively just to maximally utilize all computational units. Notable functionalities / blocks are</p><ul><li><p><strong>superscalar execution</strong> is an ability to execute more than one instruction at the given time (see multiple ports to different units).</p></li><li><p><strong>Reorder buffer</strong> reorders \instructions in queue such that two non-interfering instructions can be executed simultaneously.</p></li><li><p><strong>Register renaming</strong> renames registers, such that two non-interfering instructions operating over the same register can be executed together.</p></li><li><p><strong>Branch prediction</strong> predicts which branch will be taken and execute instructions in that branch. Misses are costly, as the processor needs to roll back emptying the instruction pipeline. The processor state is not fully restored, which may lead to side-channel attacks such as Spectre<sup class="footnote-reference"><a id="citeref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup>.</p></li><li><p><strong>speculative prefetching</strong> load instruction / data from memory to processor along the branch that is expected to be taken advance in the hope they will be executed (depends on branch predictions)</p></li><li><p><strong>Memory management unit</strong> is not shown but takes care of translation of virtual addresses to physical, checking the security bits of pages, etc.</p></li><li><p><strong>Caches</strong> (three levels) thrive to provide instructions with data from cache, such that it does not have to wait for the load. Caches are opaque to the user, he does not control, what will stay in cache.</p></li><li><p><strong>L1 Cache synchronization</strong> If the processor contains many cores, their L1 caches are atomically synchronized.</p></li><li><p><strong>Buffers</strong> are used to cache for example mapping of virtual to physical addresses, partial computations to allow rollbacks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Interrupt management</strong> CPU can interrupt its execution and transfer the execution to a different location, changing security levels.</p></li></ul><p><strong>GPU</strong> was from the very beginning designed for maximal throughput, primarily achieved by parallelism. The reason for this is simple. Imagine that you need to render a 4K image (resolution 3840 × 2160 = 8 294 400 pixels) with refresh rate 60fps in a first person shooter game. This means that you need to compute intensities of 0.5G pixels per second. Leaving our some details, this program for computing the intensity of a pixel may look something like this</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">for (i,j) in Iterators.Product(1:2160, 1:3840)
	image[i,j] = compute_insity(i, j)
end</code></pre><p>, where the computation of intensities <code>compute_insity(i, j)</code> does not contain many branches. As a result GPUs have been designed for massive parallelism with each core being as simple as possible, leaving all difficulties up to the programmer / compiler. An illustration of a modern gpu architecture is show on the example of NVidia&#39;s GPU. <img src="../nvidia-gpu.jpg" alt="nvidia-gpu"/> <img src="../nvidia-kepler.jpg" alt="nvidia-gpu"/></p><ol><li>The chip contains many streaming multi-processors (SM). Normally, each streaming processor would be called core, as it is an indivisible unit, but NVidia decided to call &quot;a core&quot; a unit inside the streaming multi-processor performing stream of operations over a set of 32bit registers.</li><li>Each streaming multi-processor contains (possibly multiple blocks of) 32-way (32-wide) SIMT units (NVidia calls that <em>CUDA Core</em>), shared memory (managed cache) and register file (16k registers, but shared among all threads). Therefore a pascal P-100 can have up to 64×4×32 = 8192 cores, which certainly sounds cool in comparison to for example 24 cores of normal processors, but given the architecture limitation we cannot expect proportional speedup.</li><li>Each streaming multi-processors (SM) has one instruction fetch and decode unit, which means that <em>all</em> CUDA cores of that SM <em>has to</em> execute the same instruction at a given cycle. This simplifies the design. The execution model therefore roughly corresponds to vector (SIMD) registers in normal CPU, but CUDA cores are not as restricted as SIMD registers. NVidia therefore calls this computation model single instruction multiple threads (SIMT). Main differences:<ol><li>SIMD requires the memory to be continuous while SIMT does not. </li><li>The programming model of SIMT is explicitly scalar while that of SIMD is explicitly vector. </li></ol></li></ol><p>32 CUDA cores each operating over 32bit registers would be equal to 1024bit long vector (SIMD) registers. Modern Intel XEON processors has 256 bit / 512 bit long registers, which seems similar, as said above in order to use them the data has to be aligned in memory and sometimes they has to be on a particular offset, which might be difficult to achieve in practice (but to be fair, if the data are not aligned in GPU, the loading of data is very inefficient).</p><ol><li>16k registers per SM might seem like a lot, but they are shared between all threads. In modern GPUs, each SM supports up to 2048 threads, which means there might be just 8 32-bit registers per thread.</li><li>GPUs do not have virtual memory, interrupts, and cannot address external devices like keyboard and mouse.</li><li>GPUs can switch execution contexts of &quot;set of threads&quot; at no cost. In comparison the context switch in CPU is relatively expensive (we need to at least save the content of registers, which is usually sped up by having two sets of registers). This helps to hide latencies, when a set of threads is stalled (they wait for memory access, synchronizing with others).</li><li>The programmer deals with &quot;raw&quot; storage hierarchy. This means that we have to manage what will be and what will not be in cache, on GPU. </li><li>Caches are synchronized only within a single SM, this much simpler in comparison with CPU, where L1 caches are synchronized across cores, which according to some researchers may presents a bottleneck with increasing number of CPU cores.</li><li>SM has relatively low frequency clocks, which helps to deal with thermal problems.</li><li>The memory in SM is divided into 16 banks, write operations to a bank is sequential. If two threads are writing to the same bank, this write is sequential, therefore one thread(s) has to wait while the other finishes (stalling).</li></ol><h3 id="Programming-/-Execution-model"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Programming-/-Execution-model">Programming / Execution model</a><a id="Programming-/-Execution-model-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Programming-/-Execution-model" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>The GPU works in an asynchronous mode. If we want to execute something on GPU, we need to </p><ol><li>Upload the data to GPU memory (if they are not already there)</li><li>Compile the <em>kernel</em> –- a code to be executed on GPU (if not already compiled)</li><li>Upload the kernel code to GPU</li><li>Request the computation of the kernel (more on this below). GPU will put the request for the computation to its queue of works to be performed and once resources are free, it will do the compuation.</li><li>The control is immediately returned, which means that CPU can continue doing its job. </li><li>CPU can issue a blocking wait till the computation is done, for example fetching the results, sychronizing with other threads in the block.</li></ol><p>Let&#39;s now look at point 4. in more detail. Recall that GPU is designed for processing data in parallel, something we can abstract as </p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">for i in 1:N
	kernel!(result, i)
end</code></pre><p>where <code>kernel!(result, i)</code> means compute the <code>i</code>-th item of the data using function <code>kernel!</code>, which is modifying as kernel function cannot return value, but has to put all results to the preallocated array. <code>i</code>-th part of the data usually corresponds to one float number (usually <code>Float32</code>). Here, we can see that SIMT has a scalar notation, we refer to individual numbers inside arrays.</p><p>Each item, <code>kernel!(result, i)</code>, is executed on a single <em>thread</em>. GPU <em>always</em> execute 32 threads at once on a single SM. This group of 32 threads is called <strong>warp</strong>. These 32 threads within warp can very effectively communicate with each other using atomic instructions. A user has to group threads into <strong>thread blocks</strong>. Each block is executed on a single SM, which means that all threads within this group have access to fast SM local memory. All blocks of single job are called <strong>grid</strong>.</p><ul><li>From the above we can already see that the number of threads has to be multiple of 32 (given by the requirement on warps).</li><li>Each block can have up to 2048 threads, which are executed on a single SM. Large number of threads in a single block is good if <ul><li>those threads needs to access the same memory (for example in Stencil operations), which can be put to the local cache and </li><li>each thread reads data from memory (which are not coalesced) and the SM can run different thread while other is stalling (mostly due to waiting for finishing loading data from memory). </li></ul></li></ul><p>On the other hand large number of threads per group might stall due to insufficient number of registers and / or other threads being busy.</p><ul><li>The total number of issued threads  has to be multiple of 32 and of the number of threads per block, hence <em>there will almost always be threads that does not do anything</em> (unless the size of the job is aligned with the number of threads spawned.</li><li>The division of a total number of items to be processed <code>N</code> into blocks is therefore part of the problem and it can be specific to a version of GPU.</li><li>For some operations (e.g. reduction seen below) to get the highest performance, you need to write the same algorithm for three levels of sets of threads  –- warp, groups, and grid. This is the price paid for exposed cache levels (we will se an example below on reduction).</li></ul><p>As has been mentioned above, all CUDA cores in one SM are processing the same instruction. therefore if the processed kernel contains conditional statements <code>if / else</code> blocks, both blocks will be processed in sequential order as illustrated below,</p><p><img src="../simt-divergence.png" alt="simt"/></p><p>which can significantly decrease the throughput.</p><h3 id="Latency-hiding"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Latency-hiding">Latency hiding</a><a id="Latency-hiding-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Latency-hiding" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>A thread can stall, because the instruction it depends on has not finished yet, for example due to loading data from memory, which can be very time consuming (recall that unlike SIMD, SIMT can read data from non-coallesced memory location at the price of increased latency). Instead of waiting, SM will switch to execute different set of threads, which can be executed. This context switch does not incur any overhead, hence it can occur at single instruction granularity. It keeps SM busy effective hiding latency of expensive operations. <img src="../latency-hiding.jpg" alt="latency hiding"/> <a href="https://iq.opengenus.org/key-ideas-that-makes-graphics-processing-unit-gpu-so-fast/">image taken from</a></p><h2 id="gpu_lecture_no_kernel"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#gpu_lecture_no_kernel">using GPU without writing kernels</a><a id="gpu_lecture_no_kernel-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#gpu_lecture_no_kernel" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>Julia, as many other languages, allows to perform certain operations on GPU as you would do on CPU. Thanks to Julia&#39;s multiple dispatch, this is almost invisible and it is sufficient to convert the <code>Array</code> to <code>CuArray</code> to notify the system that array is in GPU&#39;s memory.</p><p>For many widely used operations, we have available kernels, for example below, we use multiplication.</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">using CUDA

If we add the cost of sending and retrieving data from the memory, we have 3.5x speedup, but that is not fair. The goal is to compute everything on GPU.</p><p>How much does it cost to send the matrix to GPU&#39;s memory?

map(x -&gt; sin(x)^2 + cos(x)^2, cx)
reduce(max, cx)
reduce(max, cx, dims = 1)</code></pre><p>Notice that in case, the function in <code>map</code> and in broadcasting is essentially a custom kernel. As such, the code within has to still obey (not precisely specified) rules on what can be executed as kernel. Also needless to say, that the generic <code>map</code> over <code>CuArray</code> will try to find good launch configuration (number of threads and number of blocks), which might not be an ideal for your application.</p><p>Let&#39;s now try to use CUDA on computation of Julia set, which should benefit a lot from CUDA&#39;s paralelization, as we can dispatch each pixel to each thread –- something GPUs were originally designed for. </p><p>We slightly modify the kernel we have used in our lecture on multi-threadding, mainly to force all types to be 32-bit wide</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">using CUDA

    NVTX.@range &quot;julia set&quot; juliaset_pixel.(cis, cjs, n);
end</code></pre><p>for better orientation in the code. Note that if nvtx information does not show up in the trace we have to add it to the tracing running the profiler with <code>--trace=cuda,nvtx</code>. Lastly it is recommended to run a kernel twice in a profile trace as the first execution of the kernel in a profiler incurs some overhead, even though the code has been already compiled.    </p></div></div><p>In the output of the profiler we see that there is a lot of overhead caused by launching the kernel itself and then, the execution is relatively fast. </p><p>While Julia&#39;s JAoT greatly enhances the power of prepared kernels, you might quickly run into a case, when you are able to perform the operation on GPU, but it is very slow. Sometimes, it might be just faster to move the array to CPU, perform the operation there and move it back to GPU.

Single warp consists of 32 threads and these threads are executed simultaneously. All threads in the block are executed in the same SM, having access to the shared memory.</li><li>Each thread executes the kernel for one iteration of the for loop. This means that inside the kernel, you need to determine the index of the iteration. Therefore you will see in kernels statements like </li></ul><pre><code class="language-julia hljs"> i = threadIdx().x + (blockIdx().x - 1) * blockDim().x</code></pre><p>where <code>threadIdx().x</code> is the index of the thread within the block, <code>blockDim().x</code> is the total number of threads in the block, and <code>blockIdx().x</code> is the index of the block within the grid. <code>x</code> property suggest that you can partition the execution along three-dimensional cube (three nested for loops), which might be sometimes useful.</p><p>The most trivial example of a kernel is addition as </p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">function vadd!(c, a, b, n)
    i = threadIdx().x + (blockIdx().x - 1) * blockDim().x

The macro returns an execution context, not the actual value, which is in this case stored in <code>c</code>. You can think about the <code>@cuda</code> as moral equivalent of parallel loop.</li><li>If <code>N</code> is not divisible by <code>blockDim</code>, then there will be <strong>always</strong> threads not doing anything, therefore we need to have the <code>if</code> statement that we are within bounds.</li><li>The <code>blockDim</code> (number of threads in a block) has to be divisible by 32, which is the size of the warp.</li></ul><p>While the <code>vadd</code> example is nice, it is trivial and can be achieved by <code>map</code> as shown above.

The block level takes advantage of the all threads being executed on the single SM, which means we can synchronize threads and we have access to local mem. The reduction on the grid level of results of blocks is little sloppy, as we rely on atomic addition. This might not be a bad decision, since blocks are unlikely to finish at the same time.</p><ul><li>Within a <em>Warp</em>, we can use atomic instructions which allows to access values in other thread registers. https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/using-cuda-warp-level-primitives/</li></ul><p>But as we have said above, a group of 32 threads executed under a single warp have fast access to each other registers of threads. To exploit this, we would need to write reduction on the level of warp, block, and grid. The following code is adapted from <code>CUDA.jl</code> and it uses a trick of having a <code>neutral</code> element for the reduction operator, which is zero for addition, one for multiplication, minus infinity for maximum, etc. This neutral element simplifies &quot;padding&quot;, as we simply replace it with a neutral item.</p><p>The rational behind the code is following. Each thread will load a value to be reduced from a memory to a register –- a variable called <code>val</code> below. This means that unlike above, the number of threads is equal to the number of elements to reduce. </p><p>First, groups of 32 threads perform their reduction in function <code>demo_reduce_warp</code>, where the function <code>shfl_down_sync</code> copy a value from register holding a variable name <code>val</code> from a thread at <code>offset</code> distance. The first argument <code>0xffffffff</code> is a mask indicating which threds contain valid values. Since we load to <code>val</code> <code>neutral</code> element, all threads participating the computation is valid. As above, we perform five iterations until all 32 values are reduced and stored in the <code>val</code> of the first thread of the warp.</p><p>Second, on the block level, first thread of each warp store the reduced value <code>val</code> to local memory and from that each thread of the first warp of that block loads this reduced value to <code>val</code>. If there will be fewer number of warps in the block, we load <code>neutral</code>. After this, the first warp contains results of reduction of each warp in the block, and we can call reduction on the first warp to reduce the data, effectively reducing the block. </p><p>Third, values across block are reduced using <code>@atomic</code> approach as before.</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">@inline function demo_reduce_warp(op, val)

For example immutable parameters are always passed by value instead of the reference. </li></ul><h2 id="Sources"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Sources">Sources</a><a id="Sources-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Sources" title="Permalink"></a></h2><ul><li><a href="http://yosefk.com/blog/simd-simt-smt-parallelism-in-nvidia-gpus.html">SIMD &lt; SIMT &lt; SMT: parallelism in NVIDIA GPUs</a></li><li><a href="http://mikeinnes.github.io/2017/08/24/cudanative.html">Blog by Mike Innes on GPU programming and gradients for free</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz9IMJuW5hU">Tutorial on GPU programming at JuliaCon 2021</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/maleadt/juliacon21-gpu_workshop/blob/main/deep_dive/CUDA.ipynb">Materials for tutorial on GPU programming at JuliaCon 2021</a></li><li><a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/using-cuda-warp-level-primitives/">Using CUDA Warp-Level Primitives</a></li><li>https://juliagpu.org/post/2020-11-05-oneapi_0.1/</li><li>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKRv-W9Eg8g</li></ul><section class="footnotes is-size-7"><ul><li class="footnote" id="footnote-1"><a class="tag is-link" href="#citeref-1">1</a>Spectre side channel attack on wikipedia.
