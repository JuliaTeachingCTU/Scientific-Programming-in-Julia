# Course outline

1. Introduction

2. Type system
    - user: tool for abstraction
    - compiler: tool for memory layout

3. Design patterns (mental setup)
    - Julia is a type-based language
    - multiple-dispatch generalizes OOP and FP

4. Packages
    - way how to organize code
    - code reuse (alternative to libraries)
    - experiment reproducibility

5. Benchmarking
    - how to measure code efficiency

6. Introspection
    - understand how the compiler process the data
    
7. Macros
    - automate writing of boring the boilerplate code
    - good macro create cleaner code

8. Automatic Differentiation
    - Theory: difference between the forward and backward mode
    - Implementation techniques

9. Intermediate representation
    - how to use internal the representation of the code 
    - example in automatic differentiation

10. Parallel computing
    - threads, processes

11. Graphics card coding
    - types for GPU
    - specifics of architectures

12. Ordinary Differential Equations
    - simple solvers
    - error propagation

13. Data driven ODE
    - combine ODE with optimization
    - automatic differentiation (adjoints)
