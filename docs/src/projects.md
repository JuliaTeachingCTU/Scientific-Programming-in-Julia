# [Projects](@id projects)

The goal of the project should be to create something, which is actually useful. Therefore we offer a lot of freedom in how the project will look like with the condition that you should spent around 60 hours on it (this number was derived as follows: each credit is worth 30 hours minus 13 lectures + labs minus 10 homeworks 2 hours each) and you should demonstrate some skills in solving the project. In general, we can distinguish three types of project depending on the beneficiary:
 - **You benefit:** Use / try to solve a well known problem using Julia language,
 - **Our group:** work with your tutors on a topic researched in the AIC group, 
 - **Julia community:** choose an issue in a registered Julia project you like and fix it (documentation issues are possible but the resulting documentation should be very nice.).

The project should be of sufficient complexity that verify your skill of the language (to be agreed individually).

Below, we list some potential projects for inspiration.


## Implementing new things

### Lenia (Continuous Game of Life)
[Lenia](https://chakazul.github.io/lenia.html#Code) is a continuous version of Conway's Game of
Life. Implement a Julia version. For example, you could focus either on performance compared to the
python version, or build nice visualizations with [Makie.jl](https://docs.makie.org/stable/).

### The Equation Learner And Its Symbolic Representation

In many scientific and engineering one searches for interpretable (i.e.
human-understandable) models instead of the black-box function approximators
that neural networks provide.
The [*equation learner*](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/sahoo18a.html) (EQL)
is one approach that can identify concise equations that describe a given
dataset.

The EQL is essentially a neural network with different unary or binary
activation functions at each indiviual unit. The network weights are
regularized during training to obtain a sparse model which hopefully results in
a model that represents a simple equation.

The goal of this project is to implement the EQL, and if there is enough time
the [*improved equation learner*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06331) (iEQL).
The equation learners should be tested on a few toy problems (possibly inspired
by the tasks in the papers).  Finally, you will implement functionality that
can transform the learned model into a symbolic, human readable, and exectuable
Julia expression.

### Architecture visualizer
Create an extension of Flux / Lux and to visualize architecture of a neural network suitable for publication. Something akin [PlotNeuralNet](https://github.com/HarisIqbal88/PlotNeuralNet).

### Learning Large Language Models with reduced precition (Mentor: Tomas Pevny)
Large Language Models ((Chat) GPT, LLama, Falcon, Palm, ...) are huge. A recent trend is to perform optimization in reduced precision, for example in `int8` instead of `Float32`. Such feature is currently missing in Julia ecosystem and this project should be about bringing this to the community (for an introduction, read these blogs [*LLM-int8 and emergent features*](https://timdettmers.com/2022/08/17/llm-int8-and-emergent-features/), [*A gentle introduction to 8-bit Matrix Multiplication*](https://huggingface.co/blog/hf-bitsandbytes-integration)). The goal would be to implement this as an additional type of Number / Matrix and overload multiplication on CPU (and ideally on GPU) to make it transparent for neural networks? **What I will learn?** In this project, you will learn a lot about the (simplicity of) implementation of deep learning libraries and you will practice abstraction of Julia's types. You can furthermore learn about GPU Kernel programming and `Transformers.jl` library.

### Planning algorithms (Mentor: Tomas Pevny)
Extend [SymbolicPlanners.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlanners/SymbolicPlanners.jl) with the mm-ϵ variant of the bi-directional search [MM: A bidirectional search algorithm that is guaranteed to meet in the middle](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370217300905). This [pull request](https://github.com/JuliaPlanners/SymbolicPlanners.jl/pull/8) might be very helpful in understanding better the library.

### A Rule Learning Algorithms (Mentor: Tomas Pevny)
[Rule-based models](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/rules.html)
are simple and very interpretable models that have been around for a long time
and are gaining popularity again.
The goal of this project is to implement one of these algorithms
* [sequential covering](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/rules.html#sequential-covering)
algorithm called [`RIPPER`](http://www.cs.utsa.edu/~bylander/cs6243/cohen95ripper.pdf)
and evaluate it on a number of datasets.
* [Learning Certifiably Optimal Rule Lists for Categorical Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01701)
* [Boolean decision rules via column generation](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2018/file/743394beff4b1282ba735e5e3723ed74-Paper.pdf)
* [Learning Optimal Decision Trees with SAT](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/file/4e246a381baf2ce038b3b0f82c7d6fb4-Paper.pdf)
* [A SAT-based approach to learn explainable decision sets](www.t-news.cn/Floc2018/FLoC2018-pages/proceedings_paper_441.pdf)
To increase the impact of the project, consider interfacing it with [MLJ.jl](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/)

### Parallel optimization (Mentor: Tomas Pevny)
Implement one of the following algorithms to train neural networks in parallel. Can be implemented in a separate package or consider extending [FluxDistributed.jl](https://github.com/DhairyaLGandhi/FluxDistributed.jl). Do not forget to verify that the method actually works!!!
* [Hogwild!](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2011/file/218a0aefd1d1a4be65601cc6ddc1520e-Paper.pdf)
* [Local sgd with periodic averaging: Tighter analysis and adaptive synchronization](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/file/c17028c9b6e0c5deaad29665d582284a-Paper.pdf)
* [Distributed optimization for deep learning with gossip exchange](Distributed optimization for deep learning with gossip exchange)

## Solve issues in existing projects:

### Create Yao backend for quantum simulation (Mentor: Niklas Heim)

The recently published quantum programming library
[Qadence](https://pasqal-io.github.io/qadence/latest/) needs a Julia backend. The tricky quantum
parts are already implemented in a library called [Yao.jl](https://docs.yaoquantum.org/dev/). The
goal of this project is to take the Qadence (Python) representation and translate it to Yao.jl
(Julia). You will work with the Python/Julia interfacing library `PythonCall.jl` to realize this
and benchmark the Julia backend in the end to assess if it is faster than the existing python
implementation.

If this sounds interesting, talk to Niklas.



### Address issues in markov decision processes (Mentor: Jan Mrkos)

Fix type stability issue in [MCTS.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPOMDP/MCTS.jl), prepare benchmarks,
and evaluate the impact of the changes. Details can be found in [this
issue](https://github.com/JuliaPOMDP/MCTS.jl/issues/59). This project will require learnind a little
bit about Markov Decision Processes if you don't know them already.

If it sounds interesting, get in touch with lecturer/lab assistant, who will connect you with Jan Mrkos.

### Extend HMil library with Retentative networks (mentor Tomas Pevny)
[Retentative networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08621) were recently proposed as a low-cost  alternative to Transformer models without sacrificing performance (according to authors). By implementing Retentative Networks, te HMil library will be able to learn sequences (not just sets), which might nicely extend its applicability.

### Address issues in HMil/JsonGrinder library (mentor Simon Mandlik)

These are open source toolboxes that are used internally in Avast. Lots of general functionality is done, but some love is needed in polishing.

- refactor the codebase using package extensions (e.g. for FillArrays)
- improve compilation time (tracking down bottlenecks with SnoopCompile and using precompile directives from PrecompileTools.jl)

Or study new metric learning approach on application in animation description
- apply machine learning on slides within presentation provide by PowToon

# Project requirements
The goal of the semestral project is to create a Julia pkg with **reusable, properly tested and documented** code. We have given you some options of topics, as well as the freedom to choose something that could be useful for your research or other subjects. In general we are looking for something where performance may be crucial such as data processing, optimization or equation solving.

In practice the project should follow roughly this tree structure
```julia
.
├── scripts
│	├── run_example.jl			# one or more examples showing the capabilities of the pkg
│	├── Project.toml 			# YOUR_PROJECT should be added here with develop command with rel path
│	└── Manifest.toml 			# should be committed as it allows to reconstruct the environment exactly
├── src
│	├── YOUR_PROJECT.jl 		# ideally only some top level code such as imports and exports, rest of the code included from other files
│	├── src1.jl 				# source files structured in some logical chunks
│	└── src2.jl
├── test
│	├── runtest.jl              # contains either all the tests or just includes them from other files
│	├── Project.toml  			# lists some additional test dependencies
│	└── Manifest.toml   		# usually not committed to git as it is generated on the fly
├── README.md 					# describes in short what the pkg does and how to install pkg (e.g. some external deps) and run the example
├── Project.toml  				# lists all the pkg dependencies
└── Manifest.toml  				# usually not committed to git as the requirements may be to restrictive
```

The first thing that we will look at is `README.md`, which should warn us if there are some special installation steps, that cannot be handled with Julia's Pkg system. For example if some 3rd party binary dependency with license is required. Secondly we will try to run tests in the `test` folder, which should run and not fail and should cover at least some functionality of the pkg. Thirdly and most importantly we will instantiate environment in `scripts` and test if the example runs correctly. Lastly we will focus on documentation in terms of code readability, docstrings and inline comments. 

Only after all this we may look at the extent of the project and it's difficulty, which may help us in deciding between grades. 

Nice to have things, which are not strictly required but obviously improves the score.
- Ideally the project should be hosted on GitHub, which could have the continuous integration/testing set up.
- Include some benchmark and profiling code in your examples, which can show us how well you have dealt with the question of performance.
- Some parallelization attempts either by multi-processing, multi-threadding, or CUDA. Do not forget to show the improvement.
- Documentation with a webpage using Documenter.jl.

Here are some examples of how the project could look like:
