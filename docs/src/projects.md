# [Projects](@id projects)

We want you to use Julia for something that is acutally useful for you.
Therefore you can choose your final, graded project very freely.
We will discuss your ideas with you individually and come up with a sufficiently
extensive project together.

For you inspiration of what such a project could look like we have four
suggestions for you (which you can of course choose to work on as well).

## The *Improved Equation Learner* and its symbolic representation

## An Evolutionary Algorithm applied to Julia's AST

## A Rule Learning Algorithm

## Distributed Optimization Package
