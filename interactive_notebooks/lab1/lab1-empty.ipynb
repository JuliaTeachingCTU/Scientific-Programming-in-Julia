    "# Lab 01: Introduction to Julia\n",
    "This lab should get everyone up to speed in the basics of Julia's installation, syntax and basic\n",
    "coding. For more detailed introduction you can check out Lectures 1-3 of the bachelor\n",
    "[course](https://juliateachingctu.github.io/Julia-for-Optimization-and-Learning/stable/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing Julia installation (custom setup)\n",
    "In order to proceed further let's run a simple [script](https://github.com/JuliaTeachingCTU/Scientific-Programming-in-Julia/blob/master/docs/src/lecture_01/test_setup.jl) to see, that the setup described in chapter [Installation](@ref install) is working properly.\n",
    "After spawning a terminal/cmdline run this command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "julia ./test_setup.jl\n",
    "```\n",
    "The script does the following \n",
    "- \"Tests\" if Julia is added to path and can be run with `julia` command from anywhere\n",
    "- Prints Julia version info\n",
    "- Checks Julia version.\n",
    "- Checks git configuration (name + email)\n",
    "- Creates an environment configuration files\n",
    "- Installs a basic pkg called BenchmarkTools, which we will use for benchmarking a simple function later in the labs.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some quality of life improvements over long term support versions of Julia and thus throughout this course we will use the latest stable release of Julia 1.6.x.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Polynomial evaluation example\n",
    "Let's consider a common mathematical example for evaluation of nth-degree polynomial\n",
    "```math\n",
    "f(x) = a_{n}x^{n} + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\dots + a_{0}x^{0},\n",
    "```\n",
    "where $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $\\vec{a} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way of writing this in a generic fashion is realizing that essentially the function $f$ is really implicitly containing argument $\\vec{a}$, i.e. $f \\equiv f(\\vec{a}, x)$, yielding the following Julia code\n"

    "So far we have used the general environment (depending on your setup), which by default does not come with any 3rd party packages and includes only the base and standard libraries - [already](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/arrays/) [quite](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/multi-threading/) [powerful](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Distributed/) [on its own](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/). \n",

    "pkg> status\n",

    "```@example lab01_base\n",
    "aexp = ones(10) ./ factorial.(0:9)\n",

    "    \n",

    "- In order to import the functionality from other package, lookup the keyword `using` in the repl help mode `?`. \n",

    "    In the assignment's code, we are using quite ubiquitous concept in Julia called `broadcasting` or simply the `dot-syntax` - represented here by `./`, `factorial.`. This concept allows to map both simple arithmetic operations as well as custom functions across arrays, with the added benefit of increased performance, when the broadcasting system can merge operations into a more efficient code. More information can be found in the official [documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/arrays/#Broadcasting) or [section](https://juliateachingctu.github.io/Julia-for-Optimization-and-Learning/stable/lecture_01/arrays/#Broadcasting) of our bachelor course.\n",

This is part of the design process in Julia of a function and for the particular functionality of the `polynomial` example, we can look into the Julia itself, where it has been implemented in the `evalpoly` function\n",
